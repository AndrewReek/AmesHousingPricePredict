# AmesHousingPricePredict
Machine learning prediction of housing prices using the Ames Iowa housing dataset.

This project implements the fundamentals of machine learning to predict house prices using the Ames Housing data set.
The first sections of the notebook plot the relationships between each feature and the sale price of the home. Sklearn's
pipeline feature is utilized to combine preprocessing and cross-validation steps. Several Sklearn classifiers are tested 
and imporoved with hyperparameter optimization (grid search and randomized search) to achieve the best prediction model.
